-Start from zero-

Create a container with your future image and install what you want to start a project:
docker run -it python:3.6-alpine sh
/ # pip install django
/ # pip freeze
Then use this requirements to create you requirements.txt

Create a Dockerfile where you load requirements, and docker-compose.yml with command that launch runserver.
Execute a command in your container to start Django project:
docker-compose run django django-admin.py startproject myProject .

Now you can init your project with git and run:
docker-compose up
to start server.

docker-compose run <SERVICE_NAME> python manage.py migrate
